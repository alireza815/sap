REM  
REM  Creating the configuration files:
REM  
REM      Note: The command line should read:  C:\BORLAND\BCC55\BIN
REM  
REM      Part 1: Creating BCC32.CFG.
REM      1.  Type "edit bcc32.cfg" [Enter]  (This creates the file and opens a blank window in the editor).
REM      2. Add these lines:
REM  
REM          -I"c:\Borland\Bcc55\include"
REM          -L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib"
REM  
REM      3. Save the changes (Alt-F then hit S).
REM      4. Exit edit. (Alt+F then press X).
REM  
REM      Part 2: Creating ILINK32.CFG
REM      5. Type "edit ilink32.cfg"  (This creates the file and opens a blank window in the editor).
REM      6. Add these lines:
REM  
REM          -L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib"
REM  
REM      7. Save the changes (Alt-F then hit S).
REM      8. Exit edit. (Alt+F then press X).
REM      9. Type "exit" [Enter]
REM      10. Restart Windows.
REM   
REM You also have to convert Python's library python24.lib into the Borland format. You can do this as follows:
REM  
REM cd C:\Python25\libs
REM coff2omf python24.lib python24_bcpp.lib
REM 
REM The converted files have to reside in the same directories as the normal libraries.
REM 
REM How does Distutils manage to use these libraries with their changed names? If the
REM extension needs a library (eg. foo) Distutils checks first if it finds a library with
REM suffix _bcpp (eg. foo_bcpp.lib) and then uses this library. In the case it doesn't find
REM such a special library it uses the default name (foo.lib.)
REM 
REM Install NSIS
REM 
REM 
REM If you are installing the command line version of SAP on Windows do:
REM 
REM python setup.py setopt --command=build --option=compiler --set-value=bcpp
REM python setup.py install
REM 
REM Before you can run sap from the command line you need to do the follwoing
REM 
REM   Add a path reference to the Environment variables:
REM   3.  Using the mouse, right-click on the "My Computer" and choose "Properties".
REM   4.  Click on the "Advanced" tab or "Advanced system settings".
REM   5.  Click on the "Environment Variables..." button.
REM   6.  Highlight the "Path" System variable (bottom).
REM   7.  Click on the "Edit..." button.
REM   8.  Append the line with ";C:Python25\Scripts;"
REM   9.  Click OK on your way out.
REM 
REM Locate "Set Associations" using the search field in "Control Panels". Hithlight the ".py"
REM file extension and associate it with the python executable in C:\Python25. Do the same for
REM the ".pyc" extension.
