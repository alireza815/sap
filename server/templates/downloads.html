        <h1 class="page-header">How to get SAP running on your own machine</h1>
        <p>
            The <a href="{{ url_for('server') }}">web server</a> replaces the graphical user interfaces,
            which I will no longer maintain.
            If you want to run a lot of analyses using SAP you should install the command line tool on your own machine.
            Even if you have never used a command line tool before you will be up and running in half an hour.
            Once SAP is installed you run can run it on sequences in a fasta file <code>mydata.fasta</code> like this:
         </p>
            <pre>sap --project myanalysis  mydata.fasta </pre>

        <p>
            and your results will end up in a folder named <code>myanalysis</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Install dependencies</h2>
        <p>
            To run SAP you need Python (version 2.7 not 3.*) on your machine.
            If you are on a Mac or Unix/Linux systemÂ you already have that. If you are on Windows you need a
            Python distribution that comes with the mingw package because Python needs this to
            compile SAP. I recommend the
            <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda distribution</a> from Continuum Analytics.

            SAP also needs <a href="http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/">clustalw2</a> and <a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download">blast</a> for alignments and database search
            so you need to install them on your on your machine too.
        </p>

        <h2>Get the source code</h2>

        <p>
            The latest stable version of the source code is always available on
            <a href="https://github.com/kaspermunch/sap">Github</a> where you can download a zipped version of the code.
            If you have git installed you can clone the proejct this way:
        </p>

        <pre>git clone https://github.com/kaspermunch/sap.git</pre>

        <h2>Compile and install SAP</h2>

        <p>
            If you downloaded a zipped package you must first unpack it (not open it). Right-click and select unpack.
        </p>

        </p>
            On Mac/Linux open the Terminal application. On Windows right-click on the Cmd
            application and click "Open as administrator".
            Then navigate into the unpacked directory containing the file setup.py.
            If you are unfamiliar with the Cmd on Windows you can look
            <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm">here</a>for a guide.
        </p>

        <p>On <b>Windows</b> execute the following commands:</p>

        <pre>python setup.py setopt --command=build --option=compiler --set-value=mingw32
python setup.py install</pre>

        <p>
            On <b>Mac/Linux</b> you execute the following command:
        </p>

        <pre>sudo python setup.py install</pre>

        <p>
            Compiling the program issues a lot of warnings. Do not worry about this. If you don't get
            any error messages at the end you are fine.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you do not have admin privileges or just want to install in some non-default
            directory <code><b>some_dir</b></code> you first make sure the following set of nested directories
            exist: <code><b>some_dir</b>/lib/python2.7/site-packages</code> (if your python is 2.7).
            You then just type:
        </p>

        <pre class="example">python setup.py install --prefix=&lt;some_dir&gt;</pre>

        <!--pip install --user .-->

        <p>
        If you install in a non-default location you need to ensure that the install directory for the
            scripts is included in your PATH environmental variable and that the package install directory
            is included in the PYTHONPATH environmental variable . These variables are usually set in your
            .bachrc or .profile file like this:
        </p>

        <p>
            On <b>Windows</b> you need to help you operating system find the <code>sap</code> script by doing
            the following:

        <ol>
            <li>Using the mouse, right-click on the "My Computer" and choose "Properties".</li>
            <li>Click on the "Advanced" tab or "Advanced system settings".</li>
            <li>Click on the "Environment Variables..." button.</li>
            <li>Highlight the "Path" System variable (bottom).</li>
            <li>Click on the "Edit..." button.</li>
            <li>Append the line with ";C:Python27\Scripts\;" (if you are running python 2.7).</li>
            <li>Click OK on your way out.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
