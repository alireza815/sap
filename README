=========================================================================================

SAP makes statistical assingment of an unknown DNA sequence to taxa represented by
sequences in GenBank. Each assignment is associated with a posterior probility that serve
as a confidence in the assignment.

REQUIREMENTS:
=========================================================================================

You need the Python interpreter (version 2.4 or newer) to run SAP. If you already have
Python installed you can check the version by typing python in your terminal. Python is
easlily downloaded and installed from: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/.

You also need to have gcc and g++ or clang or clang++ installed. This is part the the
default installation on Macintosh and most Linux distributions. If you are on a Unix/Linux
system that does not include g++ by default. You need to install this yourself like this:

sudo apt-get install g++

And then make sure that gcc and g++ are the same versions like this:

gcc --version
g++ --version


INSTALATION:
=========================================================================================

If you have administrator privileges on your machine you type:

python setup.py install

If you do not have administrator privileges or just want to install in
some non-default directory you make or have a directory
/lib/python2.4/site-packages (if you use python 2.4) that is in your
python path. Then you just type:

python setup.py install --prefix=<some_dir>
