DESCRIPTION:
=========================================================================================

SAP makes statistical assingment of an unknown DNA sequence to taxa represented by
sequences in GenBank. Each assignment is associated with a posterior probility that serve
as a confidence in the assignment.

REQUIREMENTS:
=========================================================================================

You need the Python interpreter (version 2.4 or later). This is easily downloaded and
installed from http://www.python.org. A new version 2.6 is available but I recommend
installing the thoroughly tested 2.5 version. If you do not have the Active state python
version or the one that comes with OSX Leopard you will need to make sure that the python
installation includes the header file Python.h. This is the case for the the MacPython
distribution but not for linux versions. In that case you need to install the python-dev
package too. By default SAP generates ASCII graphics in the HTML output. If you want
pretty SVG graphics you will also need the Adobe's SVG plugin for your browser to view
results. This can be downloaded from http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html.
The package relies on gcc and g++ to compile extensions. If you are using Ubuntu g++ is
not installed by default. You can install it like this: "sudo apt-get install g++", and
then make sure that gcc and g++ are the same versions like this: "gcc --version" and "g++
--version"


You need the Python interpreter (version 2.4 or newer) to run SAP. If you already have
Python installed you can check the version by typing python in your terminal. Python is
easlily downloaded and installed from: http://www.activestate.com/products/activepython.

You also need to have gcc and g++ installed. This is part the the default installation on
Macintosh and most Linux distributions. For some reason, however, Ubuntu does not include
g++ by default. You need to install this yourself like this:

sudo apt-get install g++

And then make sure that gcc and g++ are the same versions like this:

gcc --version
g++ --version


INSTALATION:
=========================================================================================

If you have administrator privileges on your machine you type:

python setup.py install

If you do not have administrator privileges or just want to install in
some non-default directory you make or have a directory
/lib/python2.4/site-packages (if you use python 2.4) that is in your
python path. Then you just type:

python setup.py install --prefix=<some_dir>

FIREWALL SETTINGS:
=========================================================================================

SAP relies on netblast to access genbank. If you are behind a
firewall you may need to configure your firewass settings. The
following is copied from the netblast documentation.

The setup for NCBI network clients has been greatly simplified. Users,
not behind a firewall, can use the program after the extraction
above. For those users behind a firewall, and already use Sequin or
Entrez, or if your system administrator has already performed the
setup, they should also be able to start performing searches after
installation.

If the above are not the case, users will need to make sure that the
following IP address/port combinations are open in the firewall
configuration.

IP Address	Port Number
130.14.29.112	5861
130.14.29.112	5862
130.14.29.112	5863

Note: Please refer to 'firewall.html' included in the netblast package
for details.

In addition to this, users will need to create an .ncbirc file to
instruct blastcl3 how to make the connection to NCBI. This file should
contain the information listed below and be placed in the home
directory. For PC running Windows, the file is named ncbi.ini which
should be placed under the windows directory.

[NCBI]
DATA=/home/johndoe/netblast-#.#.#/data
[CONN]
FIREWALL=TRUE
[NET_SERV]
SRV_CONN_MODE=SERVICE

Note: Replace the path to data directory with the path specific to
your installation.

We may encounter problems while using blastcl3. The most common cause
for this problem is firewall configuration related. A representative
error message generally would contain "[CONN_Open] Cannot open
connection", "<<< Re-establishing NETBLAST Service >>>", or something
in that order.

Adding the following two lines in the .ncbirc (or ncbi.ini) file will
increase the timeout setting and generate more informative messages
that are useful in debugging the problem:

TIMEOUT=300
DEBUG_PRINTOUT=DATA

Search related errors from NCBI BLAST server typically are accompanied
by RID for the relevant searches. Those RIDs should be saved and sent
to NCBI blast-help@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for trouble shooting purposes.
